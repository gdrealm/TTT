05/19/2014. We have started to release ttt, our platform to measure and track epithelial tissues in confocal time lapses microscopy images. ttt is a companion for the recently published paper:

Cilla R, Mechery V, Hernandez de Madrid B, Del Signore S, Dotu I, Hatini V (2015) Segmentation and Tracking of Adherens Junctions in 3D for the Analysis of Epithelial Tissue Morphogenesis. PLoS Comput Biol 11(4): e1004124. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004124

Please visit the new repository we have set up at and clone the sources hosted there.
